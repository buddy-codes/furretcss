# furret.css

My personal website styling toolkit, modeled after the lovely [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/)
by Kognise. Written to allow quick and beautiful styling for simple document-like
websites. Visit the [website](https://css.furret.codes/) see it in action and get
started!

You can also use a batteries-in furret.css template [on Replit](https://replit.com/@RayhanADev/furretcss).

Or even more simply, paste the following into the `<head>` of your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://css.furret.codes/furretcss/v2/full/light.min.css" />
```
