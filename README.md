# furret.css

My personal website styling toolkit, modeled after the lovely [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/)
by Kognise. Written to allow quick and beautiful styling for simple document-like
websites. Visit the [website](https://css.furret.codes/) to try it out and get started!

Or more simply, paste the following into the `<head>` of your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://css.furret.codes/library.min.css" />
```
